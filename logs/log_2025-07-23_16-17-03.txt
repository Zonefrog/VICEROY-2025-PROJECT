The inital topics were ['LLM-content benchmarking datasets', 'LLM-content detection', 'Evading LLM detectors', 'Watermarking LLM content']. The research these yeilded is: ({Some commonly used benchmarking datasets for evaluating LLM content include the CORD-19 dataset, which consists of scholarly articles related to COVID-19, the AG News dataset, which contains news articles from various categories, and the IMDb dataset, which consists of movie reviews. These datasets are used to test the performance of LLM models in tasks such as text generation, sentiment analysis, and information retrieval.

The OpenAI Codex Dataset is a benchmarking dataset commonly used for evaluating large language models (LLMs) in the context of AI-generated content. It consists of a diverse range of text data, including code snippets, natural language text, and other forms of content. Researchers use this dataset to assess the performance and capabilities of LLMs in generating human-like text across various domains.

The General Language Understanding Evaluation (GLUE) benchmark is a widely used benchmark dataset for evaluating the performance of pre-trained models on various natu (Truncated for brevity.)}).
