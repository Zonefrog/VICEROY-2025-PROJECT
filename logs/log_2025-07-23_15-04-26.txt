6. Place the pan in the preheated oven and bake for the time specified on the cake mix box, typically around 25-30 minutes.
7. To check if the cake is done, insert a toothpick into the center. If it comes out clean, the cake is ready.
8. Remove the cake from the oven and let it cool in the pan for 10-15 minutes.
9. Once cooled, run a knife around the edges of the pan to loosen the cake, then invert the pan onto a wire rack to remove the cake.
10. Let the cake cool completely before frosting or serving.",
