One approach is to incorporate adversarial training, where the detector is trained with generated content that has been purposely manipulated to deceive it, making it more resilient to evasion attempts. Another strategy is to use ensemble methods, combining multiple detectors to improve overall detection accuracy and reduce the chances of evasion. Additionally, researchers are exploring the use of explainable AI techniques to better understand how LLM detectors make decisions and potentially identify vulnerabilities that could be exploited by evaders.Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.00149

These datasets consist of large amounts of text data that are commonly used in natural language processing and machine learning research. Researchers use these datasets to train and evaluate the performance of LLM models in generating coherent and contextually relevant text.

One of the most popular benchmarking datasets used for LLM-content generation is the COCO (Common Objects in Context) dataset. COCO is a large-scale object detection, segmentation, and captioning dataset that contains over 200,000 images. Another widely used dataset is ImageNet, which consists of over 14 million labeled images across more than 20,000 categories. These datasets are commonly used to train LLM models for tasks such as image captioning, object detection, and image generation.
