Text: Evaluation metrics are used to measure the performance of LLM-content detection models. Common metrics include accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Accuracy measures the overall correctness of the model's predictions, while precision focuses on the proportion of true positive predictions out of all positive predictions. Recall, on the other hand, measures the proportion of true positives that were correctly identified by the model. The F1 score is a combination of precision and recall, providing a balance between the two metrics. These evaluation metrics help researchers and developers assess the effectiveness of LLM-content detection models.Link: https://towardsdatascience.com/understanding-evaluation-metrics-for-language-models-1b8e3e46f252
