Title: Proper Mixing Techniques for Cake Batter
Keywords: mixing techniques, cake batter, baking, cake mix, tips
Uses: 0
Text: Proper mixing techniques are crucial when preparing cake batter to ensure a light and fluffy texture. Begin by creaming together room temperature butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Add eggs one at a time, mixing well after each addition. Alternate adding dry ingredients (flour, baking powder, salt) and wet ingredients (milk, vanilla extract) in batches, mixing until just combined. Avoid overmixing, as this can result in a tough and dense cake. Scrape down the sides of the bowl throughout the mixing process to ensure all ingredients are incorporated evenly.Link: https://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/articles/how-to-cream-butter-and-sugar
